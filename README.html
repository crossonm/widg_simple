Introduction
------------

This widg_simple repository contains my first project for the 2018/2019 'Developing Web Applications with JavaScript' course. It's a simple, one-page shopping cart application that allows the user to select 
items, add them to an online shopping cart, remove items/clear the entire order, and finalize the  order/receive a mock invoice.

A functioning version of the application can be accessed at http://marycrosson.com/jsclass/widget-cart/index9.html


Features
--------

The user starts with an empty order. Items are added to the order by clicking the corresponding
 item buttons.

Items can be deleted from the order individually or the entire order can be cleared at one fell swoop.

The order is finalized and a simple invoice summarizing the order and giving a total is generated. The user can go back and continue editing the order at this point; re-finalizing 
the order generates an updated invoice.

At the end of the process, the user has the option to print and mail the invoice with payment (it's 1998 at WAG Industries) or submit credit card information on a dummy 
form.


What I learned from the project
-------------------------------

In retrospect, and with several weeks more of the course under my belt, there are a number of things I would do differently now, among them:
  

* I used tables for part of the layout, which I now understand is 
not a best practice. It would have been better to use CSS everywhere.

* I used arrays to hold the order information. This means that the order is stored in the browser and cleared when the page is reloaded. This is okay for a demo, but for a "real 
life" application, you would store order information in a database like Mongo, where 
it is non-transiently accessible to both purchaser and seller.

* I would use a cookie to connect the user with their order so that a potential purchaser with a non-commited order would be returned to their current shopping cart.
 
* I would never in a real-world situation use an unencrypted web form to transmit
 financial data
.
