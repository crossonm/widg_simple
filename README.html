        <br>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
        This widg_simple repository contains my first project for the 2018/2019 'Developing Web Applications 
        with JavaScript' course. It's a simple, one-page shopping cart application that allows the user to select 
        items, add them to an online shopping cart, remove items/clear the entire order, and finalize the 
        order/receive a mock invoice.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <p>The user starts with an empty order. Items are added to the order by clicking the corresponding
            item button.<br><br>

        </p>
        <p>Items can be deleted from the order individually or the entire order can be cleared at one 
            fell swoop.<br><br>
            <img src="./img/edit.png" width=50% alt="screenshot of the edit part of the web app">
        </p>
        <p>The order is finalized and a simple invoice summarizing the order and giving a total is 
            generated. The user can go back and continue editing the order at this point; re-finalizing 
            the order generated an updated invoice.<br><br>

        </p>
        <p>At the end of the process, the user has the option to print and mail the invoice with 
            payment (it's 1998 at WAG Industries) or submit credit card information on a dummy 
            form.<br><br>

        <h4>What I learned from the project</h4>
    

        <p>
        In retrospect, and with several weeks more of the course under my belt, there are a number of 
        things I would do differently now, among them:
        </p>
        <p><ul>
        <li>I used tables for part of the layout, which I now understand is 
        not a best practice. It would have been better to use CSS everywhere.
       </li>
        <li>I used arrays to hold the order information. This means that the order is stored in the 
            browser and cleared when the page is reloaded. This is okay for a demo, but for a "real 
            life" application, you would store order information in a database like Mongo, where 
            it is non-transiently accessible to both purchaser and seller.
        </li>
        <li>I would use a cookie to connect the user with their order so that a potential purchaser 
            with a non-commited order would be returned to their current shopping cart.
        </li>
        <li>I would never in a real-world situation use an unencrypted web form to transmit
            financial data
        </li>
       </p>
