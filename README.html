Introduction
------------

This widg_simple repository contains my first project for the 2018/2019 'Developing Web Applications with JavaScript' course.  
It's a simple, one-page shopping cart application that allows the user to select items, add them to an online shopping cart, 
remove items/clear the entire order, and finalize the  order/receive a mock invoice. 

A functioning version of the application can be accessed at http://marycrosson.com/jsclass/widget-cart/index9.html

. 

Features
--------

The user starts with an empty order.  Items are added to the order by clicking the corresponding item buttons.  

Items can be deleted from the order individually or the entire order can be cleared at one fell swoop. 

The order is finalized and a simple invoice summarizing the order and giving a total is generated.  The user can go back and 
continue editing the order at this point; re-finalizing the order generates an updated invoice. 

At the end of the process, the user has the option to print and mail the invoice with payment (it's 1998 at WAG Industries) 
or submit credit card information on a dummy form.



In retrospect
-------------
This was the first project we did for the class, begun back in December. With several more weeks of class under my belt, there are a number of things I would do 
differently now. Instead of using tables for the gross page layout, I would use CSS/columns for this purpose. Rather than using arrays to store and display information -- which means that data is lost when the user leaves or reloads the page -- I would store and retrieve the information from Mongo DB, and I would use a cookie to connect the user with their non-commited order.
